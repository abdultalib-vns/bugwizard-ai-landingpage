# BugWizard AI
BugWizard is a sophisticated AI-powered web application designed to revolutionize bug reporting and retest workflows in Azure DevOps (ADO) and Atlassian JIRA. Operating in two powerful modes—Developer's Nightmare Mode (Bug Creator) and Developer's Chill Mode (Retester)—it automates the entire process from parsing markdown-formatted bug reports to creating work items and submitting retest comments via Azure DevOps REST API or JIRA REST API.
